# Unfortunately, the reported log-likelihood does not vary smoothly over the number
# of mixture components because models are fitted by Expectation-Maximization
# (or for reasons unknown to me but potentially related to the package?). To alleviate from
# the jiggly behaviour of the likelihood, I used a local regression in order to smooth the
# likelihood values. This part, together with the computation and the plotting of the AIC is
