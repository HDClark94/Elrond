# in_vivo_ephys_openephys
Analysis for in vivo electrophysiology recordings saved in open ephys format. 

The current pipeline runs on a linux computer and uses MountainSort to automatically sort data. The analysis is set up to minimize user interaction as much as possible, and analyses are initiated by copying files to a designated computer.

Sorted clusteres are automatically curated and output plots of spatial firing properties are generated. Spatial scores (grid score, HD score) are calculated.
